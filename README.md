To view process / results, see the HTML.

To run yourself, download everything and use the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
Some cells may take awhile to run; you have been warned.

To display the simulator visually, turn "visualize=False" to
"visualize=True" in the first python cell (line 10).
If using the visualizer, significantly lower the sample size to avoid
watching it for several hours.
